#### Vulnerabilities found in Specifikation
11 vulnerabilities found where severity of 3 are moderate and 8 are high.

<b>Vulnerabilities:</b>

<p>Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity vulnerability:[^1] </p>
<p>Regular expression denial of service (ReDoS): "A ReDoS attack attempts to slow down or even render an application unavailable. It is attacked the A as in Availability in the famous CIA triad of cybersecurity. Attackers do this by providing an application with a malicious string to be processed by its regex engine against a vulnerable (or "evil") regex pattern. The processing of the malicious string exhausts the computing power or memory available, thus impacting the application's performance and, in certain circumstances, causing a denial of service (or DoS).</p>

<p>Preventing ReDoS attacks usually comes down to good practices when defining your regex patterns."[^2] The ReDoS vulnerability is mainly due to the regex /(\s)+$/g.</p>
<p>Prototype Pollution: "Prototype pollution is a JavaScript vulnerability that enables an attacker to add arbitrary properties to global object prototypes, which may then be inherited by user-defined objects."[^3]</p>

High severity vulnerabillies:

1. debug  <=2.6.8    -Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity vulnerability and ReDoS.
2. express  2.5.8 - 4.15.4 || 5.0.0-alpha.1 - 5.0.0-alpha.5    -Depends on vulnerable versions of debug, finalhandler, fresh, qs, send and serve-static.  
3. finalhandler  <=1.0.5   -Depends on vulnerable versions of debug
4. send  <=0.15.6 - Depends on vulnerable versions of debug, fresh, mime and ms.
5. serve-static  1.1.0 - 1.12.5   -Depends on vulnerable versions of send.
6. fresh  <0.5.2    -ReDoS.
7. node-fetch  <2.6.7   -vulnerable to Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor .
8. qs  <=6.2.3    -Prototype Pollution Protection Bypass.

Moderate severity vulnerabillies:
1. mime  <1.4.1   -ReDoS.
2. ms  <2.0.0    -Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity vulnerability.
3. semver  6.0.0 - 6.3.0 || 7.0.0 - 7.5.1   -ReDoS.


<p>All vulnerabilities are fixed by running <i>npm audit fix</i>. During fixing vulnerabilities 7 packages are added, 21 packages are removed, 25 packages are changed.</p>

### Framework
In modern front-end web development, JavaScript frameworks are an essential part. These frameworks provide developers with tried and tested tools for building scalable, interactive web applications [^4]. There are differnent types of JavaScript frameworks. For example Angular, React, Svelte, Vue etc. The JavaScript framework [React](https://react.dev/) is choosen to develop the project's app. React is also known as React.js or ReactJS. The advantage React has over Angular and Vue is that it is easier to learn. 

<p>React is created and is being developed today by Facebook, which is the biggest framework today[^7]. React is used by several large websites, including Netflix, Paypal and AirBnB.
React is flexible but has high complexity, which requires good knowledge of Javascript.[^6]
React is the largest and most popular framework and is judged to be that framework which is most relevant in the labor market.</p>
